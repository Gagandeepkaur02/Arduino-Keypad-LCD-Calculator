# Arduino-Keypad-LCD-Calculator

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **arithmetic calculator** using an **Arduino Uno R3**, **4x4 Keypad**, and a **16x2 LCD**.  
The calculator can perform basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Takes numeric input from a 4x4 Keypad.
- Displays results on a 16x2 LCD.
- Handles division by zero errors

##  Hardware & Software Requirements
- Arduino Uno R3  
- 16x2 LCD + 10k Potentiometer (for contrast)  
- 4x4 Keypad  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- Arduino IDE (with `Keypad.h` and `LiquidCrystal.h` libraries)
